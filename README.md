# python.cz

Czech Python community homepage, now powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## What happened here?

In 2023-2024, there has been a volunteer-driven effort to revive this site and migrate it from Flask-Frozen to MkDocs.
For details and motivations, read [#559](https://github.com/pyvec/python.cz/pull/559).
The main bulk of the work is done, but many small details still need to be finalized.
The effort is ongoing, and you're welcome to help!
