## Jobs

How can you address Czech software engineers working in Python with your
**job offer**? Why is it **worth the effort**?

### How to find Czech Python software engineers? {: #offer }

-   Attend a [meetup](/en/#meetups) and ask around. Speak to real
    people, get them hooked for your ideas, learn about their options
    and requirements.
-   Ask your company to sponsor the next [PyCon
    CZ](http://cz.pycon.org/) or [PyCon SK](http://pycon.sk/)
    conferences. Both are unique opportunities to speak with 400+
    developers from the central-european region.
-   Write down a job offer. **Honest story instead of boring bullet
    points** will bring you larger audience. **Don\'t forget to mention
    how much is it possible to work remotely.**
-   Send the offer to django-cs and py.cz discussions (see
    [homepage](/en/#communication)) and to the [Facebook
    group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyonieri/). Many Czech
    Pythonistas are subscribed to them.
-   Please do not overuse any of the discussions. Job offers are
    welcome, they\'re free and without limitations, but if it starts to
    be annoying, it doesn\'t have to be without regulation forever.
-   Post the offer to [global job
    board](https://www.python.org/community/jobs/howto/) -- the board is
    free, only registration is needed. The offer then appears also on
    [@pyjobo](https://twitter.com/pyjobo) Twitter account. Advertise
    also at Czech job boards:

    [StartupJobs.cz](https://www.startupjobs.cz/nabidky/15/python-programmer){target="_blank"},
    ...

### I wish more Czech Pythonistas would exist! {: #more }

We too and it's also the main goal of [Pyvec](http://pyvec.org/), our
nonprofit. Pyvec is dedicated to support all sorts of activities focused
on introducing more people to Python in the Czech Republic. Pyvec also
supports local chapters of [PyLadies](http://pyladies.cz) and
[DjangoGirls](http://djangogirls.org). If you wish to sponsor our
activities, please drop an e-mail to <info@pyvec.org>.
